## Bio

I advance data and analytics (D&A) capabilities through innovative product and service development, solving real-world problems. As an enthusiastic AI/ML and data science professional, I build high-performing teams and deliver on commitments with integrity and thought leadership.

I passionately align executive and technology leadership with the firm's vision and strategy. I drive the implementation of user-centric functionalities, champion business diversity, and elevate awareness of D&A across the organization, ensuring strategic investments and fostering buy-in for business frameworks.

Utilizing my educational expertise, I instill a data culture, foster AI literacy, and provide training to employees through a self-service enterprise data catalog (EDC). Whether working with onsite, remote, or hybrid teams globally or in dispersed locations, I implement governance frameworks to standardize practices across diverse functions and business lines. This ensures adherence to data privacy and AI regulation compliance.

As an internal entrepreneur, I seamlessly integrate the latest Gen AI/AI/ML trends, transitioning prototypes into deployable proofs-of-concept. I guide strategic investments in D&A, delivering substantial business value and leading the firm's transformation into a genuinely data-centric organization.

Specialties: research and development (R&D), business frameworks, business models, innovation management, data analytics, team management, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), data science, data engineering, deep learning, large language models (LLMs), generative AI (Gen AI), and regulatory compliance.

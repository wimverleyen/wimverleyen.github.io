## Presentation

### Constructing a business framework to unshackle innovation and breakdown internal AI literacy.

In this [presentation](/assets/pdfs/AI_Accelerator_Summit_Boston_2023.pdf), we examine a business framework for formulating a business plan in the context of AI/ML innovation. Given the increasing interest in leveraging Gen AI/AI/ML, making investments in this area can pose challenges. Common obstacles include gaps in AI literacy, restricted data availability, and misalignment between AI strategy and the broader business strategy.
